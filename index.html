<h1 style="font-size:45px">About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Everett Allen III, my nickname is Ekolu simply because that's three in Hawaiian. I love my family which includes my mother, father, and my sister. I also have several pets. My dog, Tank, is a Cocker Spaniel we adopted from the Humane Society. My cat Bella loves demolishing our furniture, and my Sister’s fish. I love spending time with my family and friends. I enjoy taking my dog out on walks. </p>
