<h1 style="font-size:45px">Video Games</h1>

<p>I really enjoy videogames. Primarily open-world RPG's like Skyrim. I do also enjoy FPS's like R6S and TF2. One of the main things I enjoy about games is a games soundtrack. My favorite games include TF2, Red Dead Redemption 2, R6S, Star Wars Battlefront 2, Jedi Fallen Order, Star Wars Empire at War, and Minecraft.</p>
    
<h1 style="font-size:45px">Hiking</h1>
    
<p>I enjoy Hiking because of scenery. I enjoy hiking to High Cliff Face's and looking at the view while enjoying a sandwhich. I enkoy hiking to waterfalls and riverbeds. I especially enjoy hiking with my family. We are actually planning to go to Arizona this Summer and Hike along the Grand Canyon with my Grandparents and Cousins.</p>
